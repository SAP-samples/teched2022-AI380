## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2022 session called AI380 - Dive into Business Document Processing with AI Step by Step.  

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to the steps required to create custom templates on Document Information Extraction.

## Requirements

To get the most out of this TechEd hands-on workshop, participants of this training need to create a BTP account and a service instance for Document Information Extraction as a prerequisite step.

### Get your free trial account on SAP Business Technology Platform
To create a service instance for Document Information Extraction it is necessary to generate a trial account if you do not have one. Please remember that your trial account can be extended unlimited times in case your trial account is already expired. You will find more information [here](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html#0dcf1c45-cd6f-48cc-ae10-690765287a5a). 

### Run Booster for Document Information Extraction 
Once the account is generated, you can create your service instance for Document Information Extraction by running the Booster. [Begin with the tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-aibus-dox-booster-app.html)

*Duration: approximately 5 minutes*
